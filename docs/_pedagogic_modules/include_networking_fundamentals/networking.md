To complete these pedagogic modules you need some high-level
knowledge of networking, as it relates to the performance of distributed computing
applications.  The overall goal is to teach you what is necessary so that

details of network technologies and protocols. These fascinating topics,
which are the topic of networking textbooks, will be only touched upon
when necessary.
