The goal of this module is to introduce you to the basic concepts of running tasks
on a master/worker system.

## Basics

When hosts or clusters are referred to as either a master or a worker, the meaning is
 identical to the meaning of those words in general life. The single master or boss is
 assigning labor amongst an arbitrary number of workers. This allows the workers to be
 simple laborers that do the jobs given to them without worrying about the larger picture,
 and the master is not doing all the work themself so they can keep the larger picture
 working smoothly. The success of a master/worker system is predicated on the ability of the
  master to efficiently offload work.


### Parallelism through Master/Worker

Master/Worker can allow for parallel computing in much the same ways as we have previously discussed.
Instead of delegating an entire task to each host or core, the master can evaluate the workload
and hand off pieces of computation to workers. The worker does the computation as necessary, and returns
 the output to the master when it is finished, signalling that it has completed the assigned work. Once
 a worker is free it can be assigned work again.
