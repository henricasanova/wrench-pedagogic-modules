The goal of this module is to provide you with basic knowledge about
sequential computing (i.e., running a program on a single core).  There
is a lot of complexity there, which belongs in Computer Architecture 
and Operating Systems textbooks. We take a very high-level approach,
with the main focus being on performance.
