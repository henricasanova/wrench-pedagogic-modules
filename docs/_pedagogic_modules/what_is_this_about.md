The goal of these WRENCH pedagogic modules is for students to achieve
learning objectives in the area of high-performance, parallel, and
distributed computing.  This is achieved through several "*modules*" that
each explore relevant concepts and techniques with a clear set of learning
objectives .  Some of these modules entail hands-on experiments with
*simulators* developed with the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org/)
simulation framework.

Proceed by going through the modules in the navigation bar on the
left-hand side. Starting with [A: Sequential Computing Fundamentals]({
site.baseurl }}/pedagogic_modules/sequential_computing_fundamentals) may be
a good idea :)
