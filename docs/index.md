## Welcome to the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org)-Pedagogic-Modules,

a set of hands on educational activities aimed at teaching distributed computing concepts through the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org) 
simulation framework. Each activity can be viewed by clicking on the menu button located at the top left hand corner of the screen. Each module will 
use [Docker](https://docker.com) to run the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org) simulations. [Docker](https://docker.com) is cross platform and there
are installation instructions for [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), 
and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Once [Docker](https://docker.com) is installed, we recommend that you start with
[Activity 0: Running Your First Simulated Workflow Execution]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/activity_0)!
