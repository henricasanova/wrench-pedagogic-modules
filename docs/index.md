## Welcome to the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org)-Pedagogic-Modules,

The goal of these pegagogic modules is for students to achieve learning objectives in the area of distributed computing, in the context of scientific workflows, via hands-on experiments.
These is achieved through a set of “activities” that explore, at first introductory and later sophisticated, concepts and techniques. All these activities entail simulating workflow executions, which is done with the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org) simulation framework.

Each activity can be viewed by clicking on the menu button located at the top left hand corner of the screen. Each module will
use [Docker](https://docker.com) to run the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org) simulations. [Docker](https://docker.com) is cross platform and there
are installation instructions for [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/),
and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Once [Docker](https://docker.com) is installed, we recommend that you start with
[Activity 0: What is this about?]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/what_is_this_about)!

Please view these activities using the latest versions of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), or
