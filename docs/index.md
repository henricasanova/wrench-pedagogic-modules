## Welcome to the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org)-Pedagogic-Modules,

On this site students can learn important concepts
 and techniques in the areas of parallel, distributed, and high-performance computing.
This is achieved through *modules* that can provide hands-on leaning experiences via
*simulators* developed with the [WRENCH](http://wrench-project.org/)
framework. Proceed by going through the module sequence in the navigation bar on the
left-hand side.
